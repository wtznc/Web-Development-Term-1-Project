<p><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</strong> These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</p>

<p>Dieter Rams (Braun) - designer</p>
<p>Mike Monteiro (Apple) - designer</p>
<p>Behance.net - website</p>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong></p>

<p>Contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1</p>
<p>Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose</p>
<p>Text can be resized without assistive technology without loss of content or functionality


<p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong></p>

<p>My website can handle different screen sizes (responsive web design)</p>
<p>When users return to the website after a period of not using it, they can easily perform tasks. (simplicity and memorability)</p>
<p>I made wireframes of my design ideas and asked people about their opinions.</p>

<p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</strong> (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>

<p>I had to learn about CSS3 Transitions to animate the grid for my future projects. I searched for "css transitions" and found great websites ([4] and [5]) which enhanced my CSS skills</p>

<p>After code review sessions I decided to use a version control system (GIT), it helped me couple of times to get back to code without bugs. I found really useful information about GIT on pages [6], [7] and [8].</p>

<p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</strong></p>

<p>Smooth JavaScript and CSS animations - improve overall user experience.</p>
<p>Responsive web design - every element of the website scales according to the viewport size.
<p>Clarity and minimal design - it is crystal clear about what exactly you can do on my webpage.

<p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</strong></p>

<p>I could have used Handlebars and create templates for the grid with future projects. The final version of this website will store data in database.</p>
<p>Next time, I'd like to load images and divs dynamically while scrolling. I think I will need only basic knowledge about JavaScript and jQuery.</p>


<p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work?</strong> You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</p>
